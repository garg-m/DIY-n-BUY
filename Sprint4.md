## Sprint 4

# Description

For Sprint 4, we added functionality related to the admin/inventory manager. We added login functionality for the admin and inventory dashboard. If the admin chooses to add a new item to the inventory he can do it by filling a form. The form submission call a POST method in the backend and the page gets redirected to success page only if a response is received from the backend.

We also added more features to the cart page. In the previous sprint, once the user selects the parts, they get printed in the cart page and only clear cart option was available. In this sprint, we added a new feature where the user can delete individual items from the cart.

We added Cypress tests for the front end for new functionalities. Cypress tests are added for Amin form submission pages and cart. 


We are also successfully able to deploy the project.
