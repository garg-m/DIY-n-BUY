# DIY-n-BUY


Our application is a web application built using React.js and Go lang. It allows for hobbyists to visualize their DIY assembly of individual parts and provides a platform for ordering all those parts with a single click. The project will demonstrate this functionality using wristwatch assembly, but can be extended to serve visualizations of machine parts, circuit assembly, modern furniture etc. 

The hobbyist can create fresh builds, save those for future modifications, share them with fellow hobbyists, or continue to purchase the items used in the build. The builder tool accounts for compatibility, interoperability as well as availability of parts, along with summarizing the cost and ways of reducing it, for instance- notifying the hobbyist if any parts were purchased before. 

Today, the decision to own a mechanical watch is not a logical one. And yet, there is a broad community of watch enthusiasts who hunt for aftermarket parts and continue to surprise with the most creative builds. This holds true for many other kind of hobbyists, which is why our aim with this project is to standardize DIY visualization so that such cool pursuits continue to foster, with cool software to go with it.
