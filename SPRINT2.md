Frontend Documentation:
We developed a component where the user can select various parts of his build.
The user can do so with a drop down and the tables get populated as per his selection.

We have made the rows clickable and the selected row objects are initially stored in local storage and later picked up by API


For cypress unit tests, we have tested login, registration, forgot password, reset-password pages and drop-down menu.

Backend API Documentation:
